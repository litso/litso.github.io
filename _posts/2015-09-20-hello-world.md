Hello world!

# The Hardest thing is just to start

I've been kicking around little thoughts for a while often thinking *you know… that would make a good blog post*. The thing is, I won’t know until I try, so here goes nothing.

No more carefully nurturing ideas, safely storing them away, bring them out once in a while to admire, then filing them safely away. It's time to quit the [Brain Crack!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sHCQWjTrJ8)

# Speaking about code

I'm not the first one to notice that if writing code is hard, then writing about code is even harder. Writing comments, git commit messages, or proposing a solution on Slack — these are all skills that i’m constantly trying to improve.

Programmers (on a good day) spend a lot of time reasoning about software but when it comes to conveying that reasoning to others, or as often is the case, to convince someone of the merits of that reasoning, there is no magic formula to follow.

I’ve sometimes struggled with, and I think the core of of the challenge has to do with the fact that most writing about code is instructional and not expository. Its all about the *how* and not the *why*.

# Putting it out there

It's also hard to speak about code because after I've struggled to find a solution to something, banged my head against a problem until I've found something that works, its easy to develop an emotional attachment to it. Exposing my work to critique from others is harrowing.

Exposing my baby to the judgements of the internet's faceless hordes is not something in my comfortzone.

# The road ahead

That said, I’ve decided to take the plunge. I hope that this blog changes and adapts with me as well as with the community and thus my expectations for it will also change. That said, here is a rough manifesto of what I hope will grow here.

1. A diary about code
1. The why and not just the how
1. A showcase for my work
1. Improving my ability to speak about software
1. A habit
